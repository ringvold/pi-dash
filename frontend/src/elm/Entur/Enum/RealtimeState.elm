  - Scheduled - The service journey information comes from the regular time table, i.e. no real-time update has been applied.
  - Updated - The service journey information has been updated, but the journey pattern stayed the same as the journey pattern of the scheduled service journey.
  - Canceled - The service journey has been canceled by a real-time update.
  - Added - The service journey has been added using a real-time update, i.e. the service journey was not present in the regular time table.
  - Modified - The service journey information has been updated and resulted in a different journey pattern compared to the journey pattern of the scheduled service journey.
